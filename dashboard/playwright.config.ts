/**
 * Playwright setup for the dashboard (closes out GitHub issue #63, which the
 * old `test` script pointed at as a placeholder).
 *
 * Tests run against a production build served by `vite preview` rather than
 * the dev server, so what CI exercises is the same bundle that ships. The
 * `webServer` block builds and starts it automatically.
 *
 * ## Mock mode is explicit, and it is set here
 *
 * The e2e suite runs in mock mode on purpose, and says so in one place rather
 * than scattering `?mode=mock` through every spec. Two things follow from that:
 *
 *   - The build needs no deployed contracts and no indexer, so the suite runs
 *     on a machine that has never seen a Stellar network.
 *   - Mock mode still goes through the *same* `@stellaragent/react` hooks and
 *     the same panels as live mode — it swaps the agent underneath, not the
 *     code path. So a green suite is evidence the wiring holds, which is
 *     exactly what a fixture-import "dashboard" could never be.
 *
 * `VITE_STELLARAGENT_MODE` is read at **build** time, so it has to be on the
 * `build` step's environment and not just the preview server's.
