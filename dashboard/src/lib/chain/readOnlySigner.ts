/**
 * A `Signer` that holds no key and refuses to sign.
 *
 * ## Why the dashboard has one of these
 *
 * `StellarAgent` is built for spending, so it takes a `Signer` and uses it for
 * two different things: signing transaction envelopes, and *building* them.
 * Soroban simulation needs a source account — `rpc.getAccount(address)` — so
 * even a read-only dashboard has to name an account, and the only way to name
 * one through the existing API is to hand the agent something that can sign.
 *
 * The obvious answer, a `KeypairSigner` built from a secret pasted into a
 * `VITE_` variable, is wrong: `VITE_*` values are inlined into the JavaScript
 * bundle, which is served to every visitor of a monitoring dashboard. A read-only
 * view does not need authority, so it does not get any.
 *
 * Queries never reach `signTransaction` or `signAuthEntry` — `runInvocation`
 * returns immediately after `simulateTransaction` when `readOnly` is set — so
 * those two throw rather than pretending. If a mutation is ever wired into
 * this dashboard, it fails loudly at the first signature instead of silently
 * needing a key nobody should have.
