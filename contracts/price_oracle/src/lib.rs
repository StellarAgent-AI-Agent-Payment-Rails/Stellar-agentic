//! # Price Oracle Contract
//!
//! A minimal, single-admin price-feed contract used by `PaymentChannel` to
//! get a trusted reference price when converting between assets in
//! `pay_with_conversion`.
//!
//! ## Trust model
//!
//! This is intentionally the simplest possible design: one admin key
//! publishes prices via `set_price`, and every reader trusts whatever was
//! last published. That is a **new external trust dependency** the rest of
//! this contract suite doesn't otherwise have — `PaymentChannel`,
//! `Escrow`, and `RateLimiter` are all self-contained modulo the
//! `CircuitBreaker` (which itself requires a 5-of-N quorum of trusted
//! nodes, not a single key).
//!
//! A single admin is a reasonable *starting point* (explicitly suggested
//! by the design brief this contract implements) because it keeps the
//! on-chain surface area small and easy to audit, and because
//! `PaymentChannel` only ever uses the price as a *safety bound* on top of
//! an already-executed AMM swap (see `pay_with_conversion`'s doc comment)
//! rather than as the sole determinant of how much value moves. It is
//! **not** sufficient for a production deployment moving meaningful value:
//! a compromised or careless admin can publish a bad price and degrade the
//! slippage protection it's supposed to provide. Before mainnet use this
//! should be replaced with (or layered under) a decentralized/aggregated
//! feed such as Reflector on Stellar, or a multi-admin quorum mirroring
//! `CircuitBreaker`'s trusted-node model.
//!
//! ## Price representation
//!
//! `set_price(admin, base, quote, price)` publishes: `price` units of
//! `quote`'s base-units are equivalent to `PRICE_SCALE` (1e7, matching
//! Stellar's 7-decimal-place convention) base-units of `base`. i.e.
//! `quote_amount = base_amount * price / PRICE_SCALE`.
//!
//! `get_price` panics if no price has been published for the requested
//! pair. Callers (e.g. `PaymentChannel`) MUST treat that panic as "price
//! unavailable" and abort the whole operation rather than assuming a
//! fallback rate — an unpriced conversion must never be treated as an
//! unlimited/free one.
//!
//! ## Events
//!
//! `set_price` emits a single event with topic tuple
//! `(symbol_short!("oracle"), symbol_short!("price"))` and data payload
//! `(base: Address, price: i128)`. See `docs/events.md` for the full
//! cross-contract topic layout and indexer coverage.
