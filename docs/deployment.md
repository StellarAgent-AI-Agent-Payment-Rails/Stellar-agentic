# Deploying the StellarAgent contracts

There are **seven** Soroban contracts, four of which need a one-time
`initialize` call, and three of which hold addresses of the others that can
only be set once every contract exists. Deploying one contract with
`stellar contract deploy` — which is all `CONTRIBUTING.md` used to describe —
leaves a half-wired system whose failures surface much later as opaque RPC
errors from inside a payment.

Use the script. It does the whole sequence in the right order:

```bash
pnpm deploy:contracts --network local --source alice
```

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.84+ with the `wasm32v1-none` target
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/stellar-cli) v21+
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- A funded identity on the target network

```bash
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
stellar keys generate alice --network testnet --fund
```

---

## Quick start

### Local standalone network

```bash
stellar network start local
stellar keys generate alice --network local --fund

pnpm deploy:contracts --network local --source alice
```

### Testnet

```bash
stellar keys generate alice --network testnet --fund

pnpm deploy:contracts \
  --network testnet \
  --source alice \
  --trusted-nodes G...NODE1,G...NODE2,G...NODE3,G...NODE4,G...NODE5
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--network <name>` | `local` | Target network |
| `--source <identity>` | *(required)* | Stellar CLI identity, public key, or secret key |
| `--admin <G...>` | resolved from `--source` | Admin address for all four `initialize` calls |
| `--trusted-nodes <G,...>` | *(empty)* | Circuit-breaker trusted node set |
| `--propose-window <n>` | `720` | Circuit-breaker proposal validity window, in ledgers |
| `--out <path>` | `deployments/<network>.json` | Where to write the config |
| `--target <triple>` | `wasm32v1-none` if installed | Wasm target to build/deploy |
| `--skip-build` | off | Reuse existing WASM artifacts |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print every command without running it |

`--dry-run` is the fastest way to see the exact command sequence without
touching a network.

> **On `--source`:** prefer a saved identity name. A secret key passed on the
> command line lands in your shell history.

## What the script does

### 1. Build

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
```

**Not `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.** Under Rust ≥ 1.82 that target emits the
post-MVP `reference-types` wasm feature, which soroban-sdk 22's VM rejects at
upload time with `reference-types not enabled: zero byte expected`. `cargo
build` still succeeds, so the artifact looks fine right up until deployment
fails. `wasm32v1-none` (Rust ≥ 1.84) targets the WebAssembly 1.0 MVP and is
the correct choice. The script selects it automatically when installed and
warns when it has to fall back.

### 2. Deploy all seven contracts

| Crate | SDK field |
|-------|-----------|
| `agent_wallet_factory` | `agentWalletFactory` |
| `payment_channel` | `paymentChannel` |
| `escrow` | `escrow` |
| `rate_limiter` | `rateLimiter` |
| `circuit_breaker` | `circuitBreaker` |
| `price_oracle` | — |
| `amm_swap` | — |

`price_oracle` and `amm_swap` have no `ContractAddresses` field because the
SDK never calls them directly — `payment_channel.pay_with_conversion` does.
They still have to be deployed and initialized, which is exactly the step a
single-contract runbook misses.

### 3. Initialize — order matters

```
agent_wallet_factory.initialize(admin)
circuit_breaker.initialize(admin, trusted_nodes, propose_window_ledgers)
price_oracle.initialize(admin)
amm_swap.initialize(admin)
```

`agent_wallet_factory.initialize(admin)` must land before anything references
the factory. The circuit breaker must hold its trusted-node set before
`payment_channel` and `escrow` are pointed at it — otherwise those two are
wired to a breaker that can never reach quorum.

`payment_channel`, `escrow` and `rate_limiter` have no `initialize`: the first
two take their admin from whoever first calls a `set_*` entrypoint, and
`rate_limiter` is configured per-agent via `set_limits`.

### 4. Cross-wire

```
payment_channel.set_circuit_breaker(admin, circuit_breaker)
payment_channel.set_price_oracle(admin, price_oracle)
payment_channel.set_amm(admin, amm_swap)
escrow.set_circuit_breaker(admin, circuit_breaker)
```

Skipping any of these leaves a contract that behaves as though the emergency
pause does not exist.

### 5. Write the config

`deployments/<network>.json`:

```json
{
  "network": "testnet",
  "admin": "G...",
  "deployedAt": "2026-07-27T18:00:00.000Z",
  "contracts": {
    "agentWalletFactory": "C...",
    "paymentChannel": "C...",
    "escrow": "C...",
    "rateLimiter": "C...",
    "circuitBreaker": "C..."
  },
  "crates": { "…": "including price_oracle and amm_swap" },
  "circuitBreaker": { "trustedNodes": ["G..."], "proposeWindowLedgers": 720 }
}
```

The script also prints a ready-to-paste `.env` block.

## Wiring the SDK to a deployment

Addresses resolve in this order, highest priority first:

1. **`config.contracts`** passed to `StellarAgent.create()`
2. **`STELLARAGENT_<NETWORK>_<CONTRACT>`** environment variable
3. **`STELLARAGENT_<CONTRACT>`** environment variable
4. the per-network *unconfigured sentinel* — which always fails the check

### Environment variables

```bash
export STELLARAGENT_TESTNET_AGENT_WALLET_FACTORY=C...
export STELLARAGENT_TESTNET_PAYMENT_CHANNEL=C...
export STELLARAGENT_TESTNET_ESCROW=C...
export STELLARAGENT_TESTNET_RATE_LIMITER=C...
export STELLARAGENT_TESTNET_CIRCUIT_BREAKER=C...
```

The network-scoped form lets one process talk to more than one network.

### Explicit config

```typescript
import deployment from '../deployments/testnet.json' with { type: 'json' };

const agent = await StellarAgent.create({
  network: 'testnet',
  contracts: deployment.contracts,
});
```

> **Why not have the SDK read `deployments/*.json` itself?**
> `@stellaragent/core` is bundled for browsers as well as Node — the dashboard
> imports it directly — so it cannot `fs.readFile` a path at runtime without
> breaking that build. Environment variables are the portable channel;
> importing the JSON yourself, as above, is the file-based equivalent.

---

## The fast-fail check

`StellarAgent.create()` validates every contract address before returning and
throws `ContractsNotDeployedError` if any is not a real deployed contract ID:

```
Contracts not deployed for network "testnet" — see docs/deployment.md

Unconfigured or invalid: agentWalletFactory, paymentChannel, escrow, rateLimiter, circuitBreaker

Fix this by either:
  1. Deploying them:  pnpm deploy:contracts --network testnet
     (writes deployments/testnet.json and prints an .env block)
  2. Passing known addresses explicitly:
       StellarAgent.create({ network, contracts: { paymentChannel: 'C...' } })
  3. Setting environment variables:
       STELLARAGENT_TESTNET_AGENT_WALLET_FACTORY=C...
       …
```

Validation is a strkey checksum check, not a pattern match against the known
placeholders, so it also catches truncated addresses, addresses pasted from
the wrong network, and single-character typos.

### Opting out

`getBalance()` is a Horizon query that touches no contract. To use an agent
for read-only work on a network with nothing deployed:

```typescript
const agent = await StellarAgent.create({
  network: 'testnet',
  allowUnconfiguredContracts: true,
});
await agent.getBalance();   // fine
await agent.openChannel(…); // still fails
```

## Manual runbook

If you cannot run the script — an air-gapped signer, a hardware wallet, a
network the CLI has no profile for — this is the same sequence by hand. Set
`SRC` and `ADMIN` first.

```bash
export SRC=alice
export NET=testnet
export ADMIN=$(stellar keys public-key $SRC)

cd contracts
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
WASM=target/wasm32v1-none/release

# ── 1. Deploy all seven ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
deploy() { stellar contract deploy --wasm $WASM/$1.wasm --source-account $SRC --network $NET; }

FACTORY=$(deploy agent_wallet_factory)
CHANNEL=$(deploy payment_channel)
ESCROW=$(deploy escrow)
LIMITER=$(deploy rate_limiter)
BREAKER=$(deploy circuit_breaker)
ORACLE=$(deploy price_oracle)
AMM=$(deploy amm_swap)

# ── 2. Initialize, in this order ───────────────────────────────────────────
stellar contract invoke --id $FACTORY --source-account $SRC --network $NET \
  -- initialize --admin $ADMIN

     --propose_window_ledgers 720

stellar contract invoke --id $ORACLE --source-account $SRC --network $NET \
  -- initialize --admin $ADMIN

stellar contract invoke --id $AMM --source-account $SRC --network $NET \
  -- initialize --admin $ADMIN

# ── 3. Cross-wire, only after all seven exist ──────────────────────────────
stellar contract invoke --id $CHANNEL --source-account $SRC --network $NET \

  -- set_circuit_breaker --admin $ADMIN --circuit_breaker $BREAKER

# ── 4. Export for the SDK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
cat <<EOF

```

---

## Redeploying

`stellar contract deploy` always produces a **new** contract ID — there is no
in-place upgrade here. A redeploy means new addresses and empty state:
existing channels, jobs and rate limits do not carry over.

Re-running the script therefore does **not** reuse the previous deployment —
it deploys a fresh set of seven contracts with new IDs and empty state, and
writes a new config. The previous deployment is left on-chain, orphaned.
Anything still pointed at the old addresses keeps talking to the old
contracts.

The script does tolerate an `already initialized` panic and skip past it
rather than aborting mid-sequence, but note that a normal re-run will not
trigger that: because every deploy mints new contract IDs, `initialize` is
always hitting fresh state. That guard only matters if you point the
initialization steps at contracts deployed some other way.

### Testnet redeploys in CI

`.github/workflows/deploy-testnet.yml` runs the same script on manual
dispatch. It is deliberately **not** wired to every push to `main` — each run
mints new contract IDs and orphans all existing testnet state, which is not
something a merge should do silently. Trigger it from the Actions tab, then
update the `STELLARAGENT_TESTNET_*` repository secrets from its output.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`Contracts not deployed for network "…"`**
Nothing is configured. Deploy, or set the environment variables the error
lists.

**`already initialized`**
The contract was initialized by an earlier run. Expected on a redeploy; the
script skips it.

**`WASM not found: …`**
You passed `--skip-build` without having built for the target the script
selected. Drop the flag, or build that target explicitly.

**`HostError: Error(WasmVm, InvalidAction)` / `reference-types not enabled: zero byte expected`**

The contract was built for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with Rust ≥ 1.82. That
target emits the post-MVP `reference-types` feature, which soroban-sdk 22's VM
rejects at upload. The trap is that **`cargo build` succeeds** — the artifact
is simply undeployable, so nothing fails until you try to upload it.

```bash
rustup target add wasm32v1-none
cd contracts && cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
```

The script picks `wasm32v1-none` automatically when it is installed, and warns
when falling back. Override with `--target <triple>` if you need to.

Note that `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=-reference-types"` does **not** fix
this — the feature comes from the precompiled `core`/`std` for that target,
not from your crate's own codegen.

**`quorum not reached` when pausing**
Fewer than five distinct trusted nodes have called `propose_pause` inside the
validity window, or the trusted set has fewer than five members. Rotate it
with `circuit_breaker.set_trusted_nodes`.

**Calls fail after a successful deploy**
Cross-wiring was skipped. Re-run steps 3–4 of the manual runbook, or re-run
the script — the `set_*` entrypoints are idempotent for the same admin.

## Storage and Rent Costs

All contracts are configured to automatically manage their own TTLs to prevent archival on live networks:

- **Instance storage** (which holds channels and jobs) is bumped on every write operation.
- **Persistent storage** (voucher allocations and settlements in `payment_channel`) is bumped on access.

The standard policy bumps entries to **30 days** of lifetime when their remaining TTL falls below **7 days**. This means most calls will not incur a rent fee; however, callers whose transactions happen to push an entry back above the threshold will pay the state archive rent cost for that extension. Be prepared for slightly variable transaction fees depending on whether a state bump was triggered.
