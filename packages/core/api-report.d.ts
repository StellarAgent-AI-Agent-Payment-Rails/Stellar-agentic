/**
 * Deterministic fixed-point arithmetic for Stellar agent payment calculations.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * JavaScript's native `number` type uses IEEE 754 double-precision floating
 * point.  The x87/SSE2 FPU on x86 processors and the VFP/NEON unit on ARM
 * (M1/M2) can produce **different intermediate rounding results** for the same
 * mathematical expression, causing hash mismatches when agent bid scores are
 * used in on-chain operations.
 *
 * This module solves that by delegating every calculation to `bignumber.js`,
 * which implements arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic in **pure
 * JavaScript** (no native bindings) and is therefore completely deterministic
 * across all CPU architectures and operating systems.
 *
 * ## Design rules
 * - **Never** use native `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` or `Math.*` on monetary/score
 *   values.  Always use the helpers exported here.
 * - Monetary amounts are always represented as **strings** at the API
 *   boundary so JS floats never touch them.
 * - On-chain values use `i128` stroops (integer).  Use `toStroops` /
 *   `fromStroops` to convert.
 * - `STROOP_SCALE` = 10 000 000 (1 XLM = 10^7 stroops), matching Stellar.

/**
 * Deterministic agent bidding algorithm.
 *
 * ## Background
 *
 * When multiple agents compete for an escrow job the requester (or the
 * on-chain arbiter) needs a reproducible **bid score** so the same input
 * always produces the same winner, regardless of which CPU architecture
 * computed it.
 *
 * Historically this was done with native JS floats, which diverge between
 * x86 (SSE2) and ARM (M1/M2 NEON) due to intermediate-precision differences
 * in the FPU pipelines.  This file replaces every float operation with calls
 * to the `fixed-point` module, which uses `bignumber.js` pure-JS arithmetic.
 *
 * ## Scoring formula
 *
 * Each bid is scored 0–100 using a weighted combination of:
 *
 *   score = (priceWeight   × priceScore)
 *         + (repWeight     × repScore)
 *         + (latencyWeight × latencyScore)
 *         + (reliabWeight  × reliabScore)
 *
 * Where individual sub-scores are normalised to [0, 100]:
 *   - priceScore   = 100 × (1 − bid / maxBid)   — lower price is better
 *   - repScore     = reputation (0–100 input)
 *   - latencyScore = 100 × (1 − latency / maxLatency) — lower latency better
 *   - reliabScore  = successRate × 100           — 0.0–1.0 input
 *
 * All weights must sum to 1.0 (expressed as decimal strings).

/**
 * Off-chain-verifiable attestations for bid scoring.
 *
 * ## Background
 *
 * {@link rankBids} and {@link selectBestBid} (see `./bid.ts`) are pure,
 * deterministic functions, but they are trusted, off-chain ones: whoever runs
 * the scoring service can simply not run it, or run it and then tell the
 * counterparty about a different "winner" than the one it actually computed.
 * A worker that is only handed a bid set and a claimed result has no way to
 * check that after the fact.
 *
 * This module lets the scoring service produce a **signed attestation**
 * alongside its result, and gives any third party — a worker, an auditor, an
 * arbiter — a standalone verifier that needs nothing from the scorer except
 * that attestation, the original bid set, and a directory of which public
 * keys the scorer is allowed to sign with. The verifier both re-derives the
 * ranking itself (catching a scorer that reports a different bid than the one
 * it actually computed) and checks the signature (catching tampering with the
 * bids or the reported result in transit).
 *
 * This is the lighter-weight, off-chain alternative to full on-chain
 * commit-reveal settlement — useful before that lands, or for callers that
 * don't want the on-chain settlement overhead at all.
 *
 * ## Key rotation
 *
 * An attestation names the `keyEpoch` it was signed under rather than only a
 * bare public key. Verification takes a {@link ScorerKeyDirectory} mapping
 * epochs to public keys (plus an optional validity window per epoch), not a
 * single hard-coded key. That makes rotation a directory update instead of a
 * breaking change:
 *
 * - Retiring a key means giving its epoch a `validUntil`, or dropping it from
 *   the directory outright once no attestation signed under it needs to
 *   verify any more. Attestations already issued before that cutoff keep
 *   verifying; new ones claiming that epoch after the cutoff do not — so a
 *   compromised key can be cut off going forward without invalidating
 *   history.
 * - `issuedAt` / `expiresAt` bound every attestation's own lifetime
 *   independently of key rotation, so a leaked (bids, result, attestation)
 *   tuple can't be replayed indefinitely as "proof" of a stale ranking.

/**
 * Signing abstraction.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * `StellarAgent` was built entirely around `Keypair.fromSecret(config.secretKey)`
 * and exposed `get secretKey()` returning the raw secret string. For an agent
 * running with real funds that is a serious risk: the secret sits in a
 * long-lived Node.js process for its whole lifetime, reachable from a heap
 * dump, a `process.env` leak, an error report that serialises the object
 * graph, or any of the many transitive dependencies `@stellar/stellar-sdk`
 * pulls in.
 *
 * This module separates *what to sign* from *what holds the key*. The agent
 * gets a {@link Signer}; where the key actually lives is the Signer's
 * problem.
 *
 * ## The interface shape
 *
 * `signTransaction` / `signAuthEntry` over base64 XDR is deliberately the
 * same shape as SEP-43, the Stellar wallet-interface standard. That means an
 * existing browser wallet, a hardware device, or a signing service can be
 * adapted with a thin wrapper, and it keeps the boundary at "here are bytes,
 * give me back signed bytes" — the narrowest interface that never requires
 * key material to cross it.
 *
 * Soroban needs both halves: `signTransaction` covers the transaction
 * envelope, and `signAuthEntry` covers `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` values,
 * which are signed separately from the envelope that carries them.
 *
 * ## Why a remote-signing service rather than Ledger
 *
 * The issue asked for one remote backend — a Ledger integration or a
 * remote-signing RPC protocol — and said to document the choice. This module
 * implements {@link RemoteSigner}, an HTTP signing service.
 *
 * A Ledger requires a physical button press for every signature. That is a
 * good property for a human treasury and a fatal one here: the entire premise
 * of this SDK is an *autonomous* agent paying $0.001 per API call without a
 * human in the loop. A hardware wallet cannot serve an unattended process
 * making a payment per inference request — the first payment would block
 * forever waiting for a press. Hardware signing is the right answer for the
 * *admin* keys that deploy and configure contracts; it is the wrong answer
 * for the agent's hot operational key, which is what `StellarAgent` holds.
 *
 * A remote signing service does fit: the key lives in an HSM/KMS behind a
 * network boundary, the agent process holds only a URL and an auth token, and
 * the service is where policy belongs — rate limits, spend ceilings, an audit
 * log, revocation. Compromising the agent process then yields the ability to
 * *request* signatures subject to that policy, not the key itself. Rotation
 * means rotating a token, not redeploying every agent.
 *
 * {@link SignerAdapter} exists for anyone who does want Ledger or a browser
 * wallet: both already speak the SEP-43 method shape.

/**
 * Pre-flight prediction of whether a proposed payment would be blocked by
 * either a `PaymentChannel`'s per-period spend limit or a configured
 * `RateLimiter`, computed entirely off already-fetched on-chain state — no
 * RPC round trip, no transaction fee.
 *
 * This is a deliberately low-level, environment-agnostic function: it takes
 * plain state objects rather than live contract clients, so it's usable from
 * `@stellaragent/react`'s `useRateLimitStatus` hook, a future CLI dry-run
 * command, or a test — anything that already knows the relevant on-chain
 * state.
 *
 * ## Why this has to replicate the contracts' own logic, not just call them
 *
 * Both `PaymentChannel.pay` and `RateLimiter.check` reset their rolling
 * windows (`spent_this_period` / `hourly_spend` + `daily_spend`) *before*
 * evaluating the proposed amount, whenever the current ledger has moved past
 * the window's expiry — see `reset_windows_if_needed` in
 * `contracts/rate_limiter/src/lib.rs` and the inline reset in
 * `contracts/payment_channel/src/lib.rs`'s `pay`. A caller holding
 * yesterday's `spentThisPeriod` would otherwise predict a block that the
 * chain itself will not enforce (the window already rolled over). This
 * module takes `currentLedger` explicitly and performs the same
 * reset-then-check sequence.
 *
 * ## Boundary conditions matter
 *
 * Every one of the contracts' own limit checks uses strict `>` (a payment
 * that lands *exactly* on the limit is allowed) except the hourly
 * transaction-count check, which uses `>=` (once `max_txs_per_hour` slots are
 * used, the next one is refused). Getting these backwards is an off-by-one
 * that either double-blocks a legitimate last payment or lets one through
 * that the chain would reject — the source of truth for every comparison
 * below is cited inline against `contracts/rate_limiter/src/lib.rs` and
 * `contracts/payment_channel/src/lib.rs`.
 *
 * ## A deliberate faithfulness quirk: `active` does not gate `check()`
 *
 * `RateLimiter.kill_agent` sets `RateLimit.active = false`, but
 * `RateLimiter::check` never reads that field — only `is_active()` (a
 * separate query) does. So a killed agent's `check()` call still evaluates
 * (and can pass) the per-tx/hourly/daily/tx-count comparisons on-chain today.
 * This function mirrors that exactly, because its contract is "agrees with
 * `RateLimiter.check`", not "agrees with what `RateLimiter.check` probably
 * should do". `RateLimitSpendState.active` is exposed for callers that want
 * to surface a "killed" badge, but it does not participate in `wouldBlock`.

/**
 * Contract address resolution.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * `DEFAULT_CONTRACTS` used to hard-code addresses like
 * `CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` for testnet
 * and empty strings for mainnet/local. Those are not real contract IDs — they
 * are 60-61 characters long where a Stellar contract ID is exactly 56, and
 * none of them carry a valid strkey checksum. Any call made against them
 * would have failed deep inside a Soroban RPC round-trip with an opaque
 * error, long after the real mistake (never having deployed) was made.
 *
 * This module replaces that with three things:
 *
 * 1. An explicit, named set of **unconfigured sentinels** — the same fake
 *    values, but now labelled as what they are rather than posing as
 *    deployment output.
 * 2. **Resolution** from environment variables, so a real deployment can be
 *    supplied without recompiling.
 * 3. A **fast-fail check** that rejects an unconfigured or malformed address
 *    at `StellarAgent.create()` time with a message pointing at the runbook.
 *
 * ## Why environment variables rather than reading the generated file
 *
 * `scripts/deploy.ts` writes `deployments/<network>.json`. This package,
 * however, is bundled for browsers as well as Node — `@stellaragent/dashboard`
 * imports it directly — so it cannot `fs.readFile` a path at runtime without
 * breaking that build. Environment variables are the portable channel (the
 * issue sanctions either), and the deploy script prints a ready-to-paste
 * `.env` block alongside the JSON so the two stay in step. Callers who do
 * want the file can import the JSON and pass it as `config.contracts`, which
 * takes precedence over everything here.
