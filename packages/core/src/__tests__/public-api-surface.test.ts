 * A snapshot of every name `@stellaragent/core` exports at runtime (classes,
 * functions, constants — not types, which leave no runtime trace to
 * snapshot). This is deliberately coarse: it exists to catch an
 * accidentally added or removed export falling out of the `index.ts`
 * module split, not to police type-level signature changes — that's what
 * `packages/core/api-report.d.ts` (see `pnpm docs:api:check`) is for.
 *
 * A failure here means the public surface changed. If that was intentional,
 * update the snapshot *and* run `pnpm docs:api` to keep the API report and
 * generated reference in step with it.
